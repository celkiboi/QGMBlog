            <p>
                Croatian hypercar company Rimac Automobilis latest hypercar is a car that tests the limits of speed. 
                With its 1914 horsepower and 2300 Nm of torque, can it become the fastest car in the world, or will it fall short?
            </p>
            <p>
                For those unaware, Rimac is a Croatian car company founded in 2009. Despite their age, they have demonstrated that they 
                know how to build a car. The original 2016 Rimac Concept One was a thing of magic, being produced in 8 examples, 
                with 7 remaining
                (<a class="link" href="https://topgear.fandom.com/wiki/Hammond%27s_Rimac_Crash_(TGT)">see Richard Hammonds crash</a>).
                Despite a few issues, the car was way ahead of its time and 
                was considered to be one of the fastest cars of its time. Now, the legendary Concept One has a successor, the Nevera.

            <p>
                Nevera has managed to break 23 records in one day (including the record for most records in a day). 
                Yet still, that is not the most surprising thing about it. As a GT hypercar, meant to rival the Bugatti Chiron,
                 it's incredibly easy to drive, and it's incredibly comfortable. With 120 kWh of usable battery capacity and efficiency 
                 of 25-30 kWh/100km, it will easily get you 500 km of range in eco-driving, while the figure drops to 400 km when 
                 you spend less time being careful. With fast road driving, the figure can drop as low as 160 km, but that is to be 
                 expected, from a car that has nearly 1.5 MW of power. The interior is incredible, with build quality on par with the 
                 best of Porsche. With Android Auto, Apple car play, and a custom-built Focal sound system, you really can just relax 
                 and not take things too seriously.

            <p>
                Nevera is a proper speed demon. With 1400+ KW of power and 2300+ Nm of torque, it shatters every single acceleration record. 
                Don't think it's a one-trick pony when it comes to performance. With custom-built Brembo brakes and an aero break, 
                it's really good at braking. Cornering too, is marvelous. Great suspension, low center of gravity, active aero and torque 
                vectoring make going around corners incredibly fun, proven by the fact that the car goes 7:05 around the ring, 
                some 30 seconds faster than its rival, Chiron. The top speed is 412 km/h, so it doesn't bog down like other electric cars.
            </p>
            <h3>So what is our verdict?</h3>
            <p>
                The Nevera is absolutely deserving of hype. The way it drives, the way it rides is something that we haven't seen so far. 
                It absolutely deserves to be named "the fastest car in the world".<br/><br/>
